# StreaX Task
Creating the SmartContract and the test cases
I have used the Hardhat for testing my SmartContract and the tests are written in the test folder given 
The SmartContract is there in Contract folder and Script to deploy 

To test the SmartContract use command npx hardhat test -testfilelocaion    and all test will run automatically

I have also used matamask wallet to ensure that tokens get deposited in our metamask wallet using Remix IDE and using georli test network
